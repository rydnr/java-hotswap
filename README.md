# java-hotswap

A mechanism to hotswap Java classes and resources at runtime.

## Overview

This repository aims to build a command-line tool capable of reloading changed classes and resources in a running JVM. The long-term goal is an extensible solution inspired by JRebel that works with standard Maven and Gradle builds.

See [docs/design.md](docs/design.md) for the architecture sketch, proof-of-concept checklist and growth plan.
